Buildings change their background color as they incur damage - going from initially green to yellow to red - and finally getting destroyed.

Cannon and Wrizard tower become red when they are shooting at your troops.

## Troops

1. **Barbarian** - A simple ground troop that can attack buildings. It has to reach a building to attack it.

```

Troops are automated characters that will move around the map and attack buildings.

Troops will change their brightness as they take damage - going from initially bright to normal to dim - finally turning into tombstones when dead.

### Royal Troops

1. **King** - A ground troop that can attack buildings. It has to reach a building to attack it. It has a special ability of using its *Leviathan Axe*. This will cause all buildings within its vicinity to be damaged.
```
